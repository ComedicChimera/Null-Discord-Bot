General
-------

General Commands are commands that are primarily used for making queries regarding 
Null and how to use the bot.

- `prefix [prefix]`

    Used for getting or setting the current server prefix.  If the argument is left 
    blank, it returns the current server prefix.
    
    **Permissions**
    
    * Administrator
    
- `about`

    Prints an about page containing basic data about Null and its server.
    
- `help [command]`

    Help redirects you to the command documentation and provides information 
    about your Null Bot instance.  When passed with arguments, it will send 
    a specific help page to the user through a private channel describing how the
    command works.  *Not all commands have help pages.*
    
    **Note** If the command either doesn't have a help page or doesn't exist, Null 
    will do nothing.
